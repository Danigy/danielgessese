I'm a maker, a do-it-yourself (DIY) person, who likes to build things and make them work. I also consider myself as a maker, a hobbyist or experimenter who designs and constructs devices for fun or learning. In short, as I a maker like to creating, fixing things and hacking, or purposing, equipment for improved performance or some new application.
